## Mapping for Housing Justice

### Chris Henrick & Michael Zyggy Mintz

Housing Justice - Housing is a human right, but people struggle globally & locally to find a place to live. Changing the system from profit to people
[North West Bushwick Community Group](http://www.nwbcommunity.org/)
Lots of maps produced by the city exist at the city scale and that's not always useful - definitely something to think about for LHS
[North West Bushwick Community Map](http://www.bushwickcommunitymap.org/)
Multiple stories:

- Gov rezoning
- prvt development
- tough times???

Who's the audience? General public as well as housing activists? They went with all, but always hazy.

Can we get to the history of disinvestment
How can we get data on displacement? Does it start with narratives? Ethnographic research...

Learning new things takes persistence & practice
passion is good
one-off trainings is not great, more regular trainings better
confidence with new task takes time

## Starting Conversations for More Accessible Maps

### Kitty Hurley, Alison Link, & Mitch Schaps

1. Design for a **diverse** set of users
	- Have a conversation about accessibility
	- *A Web for Everyone* - nice book on web accessibility
2. Appreciate that people perceive space in very different ways
	- allocentric - birds-eye view
	- egocentric - starting with the self
	- maps vs routes
3. Design can kill your message
	- Wrong color scheme can alienate users
	- Simpler is better
	- Red-green is a bad color scheme
4. Accessibility is not a barrier to innovation
	- usability first, accessibility next
	- design/organization especially in HTML code
	- mobile...design for it
	- focus: see where people tab through
