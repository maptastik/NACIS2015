Terrain Tools toolbox
Sweet Python action
- Cluster Hillshade
	- Clusters of similar terrain "lots of mini-hillshades"
	- includes an elevation modification and slope!!!
		- Look into this for WMA
- Sky modelled
	- I think simulates sky conditions
- Pan sharpening
- Hypsometrically tinted contours
- Illuminated contours (Tanaka)
	- Apparently you can do that with Arc pretty easily
- 3D Chorpleth
	- Terrain tools can be used on statistical data

Designer as Carographer

Cartographer's checklist:

- purpose of map
- audience
- format/scale
- produced & reproduced

graphic design is  about making things beautiful, but maps have a function and need to be accurate

> Can't we have beauty and usability? Marry form and function?

data == narrative; ???
design == narrative; this makes more sense

- gis doesn't always require a server
- gis can be data-first, not operation first
- gis is open

THIS IS SO COOL.

### Dude from Stamen

### Ross Donihue

[Maps for Good](http://mapsforgood.org/)
We should be looking at this for LexHousingStudies
Also for 
"We save the places we love. We love the places we know..." 
Intangible layers...what give place it's meaning
Mapping the intangible

- color
	- draw on the colors of the place to create a map color scheme that matches the place
	- blur and smudge to generalize colors in PS/GIMP
- Talk about your work
	- Unexpected things can occur when you talk to people not associated with your project
- Audio recordings
- Skeleton maps
	- stripping the map to a point where you can have collaborators embed their stories in the map

### Nicole Samu

### Brian Davidson

- Claim a map
- Create a map (for article that doesn't have one)
