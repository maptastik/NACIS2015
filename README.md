# NACIS2015
My repo for nacis things

- An ~11 year old girl came into our office with her parents and sisters. Her dad worked with my colleague to figure out an addressing situation. In the meantime, the girl showed a lot of interest in our maps and wanted to buy one. I offered to have her come check out some of the webmaps we've made, to see her house on our Sanborn webmap. We then walked through how to make a quick map on Google Maps. I told them they could get a Google account and make their own maps, which made her excited! She thought it was really cool when I changed the icon colors and shapes. But she's also been tracking the trains that run behind her house. She is the future.
