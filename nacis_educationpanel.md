1. What is the relationship between Geography and Cartography?
	- geography = 'earth writing'
	- cartography = 'map writing'
	- It's a visual language for communicating an understanding of spaces, places, and the relationships within and without
2. What mapping technologies and approaches do you currently advocate, teach, and/or use?
	- I try to be platform agnostic with bias towards more open source platforms that have a high return on one's technical and emotional investment in learning. That said I want to meet people where they are. For those unacquainted with geospatial tech, that usually means very simple like Mapbox Editor, CartoDB's Odyssey. But if people have used Google Earth/Maps or have access to ArcGIS and have some comfort level with those types of geospatial tech, then I'm going to cater to that familiarity.  
3. What kinds of courses or educational opportunities in mapping should higher education support?
	- 
4. Given the rapid pace of change in mapping technologies and approaches, how must higher education adapt?
	- The technology is changing, but many of the core concepts and operations are pretty old. Curriculum should be built around these core concept rather than a particular suite of technology. Still, give students access to particular tool training if they want to learn a particular platform.
5. What is the unique responsibility of industry regarding these changes and their impacts on higher education?
	- I don't know about responsibility. I think most industry players are pretty open about the changes they make. That said, I'm a big fan of documentation that includes fully functional examples. I'm thinking of Mapbox JS with the examples section in their API documentation or Esri's resource pages for their geoprocessing tools. I feel like those more comprehensive forms of documentation can make it a little smoother process for integrating changes into curriculum.
